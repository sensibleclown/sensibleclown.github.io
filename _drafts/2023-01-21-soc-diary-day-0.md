From now on I’m going to start writing a series of articles about SOC development and operation as part of my daily routine. I will focus on topics such as threat intelligence, incident response, security automation, and security operations best practices. I will also provide case studies and examples of how to apply these topics in real-world scenarios.

I aim to make my articles useful for both experienced security professionals and those just starting out in the field. I will include detailed explanations of each topic and provide links to additional resources for further study. My goal is to create a comprehensive guide that can help readers better understand the nuances of SOC development and operation.

I plan to update my articles regularly starting with the development of an SOC and then proceeding to the operation. I will also update my articles with new information and insights into the latest trends in the industry. In addition, I will be open to feedback from readers so that I can continue to refine my content and keep it up-to-date with changes in the field.

## Building SOC

Building a Security Operations Center (SOC) is an important step in securing an organization's infrastructure and data. A SOC is a centralized team responsible for monitoring and analyzing an organization's security posture, identifying potential threats, and responding to security incidents. The SOC team typically consists of SOC Managers, security analysts, system administrators, incident responders and Threat intelligence officers.

The first step in building a SOC is to assess the organization's current security posture and identify any gaps or weaknesses. This assessment should include an inventory of all systems, applications, and networks, any existing policy or procedures, the type of threats that the organization is most likely to face, the critical systems as well as data that need to be protected.

The next step is to develop a strategy for the SOC that outlines its mission and objectives, including how it will monitor the organization's environment and respond to threats. Additionally, organizations should determine how they will measure the effectiveness of their SOC.

One of the key components of a SOC is a robust security incident response plan. This plan should outline the processes and procedures for responding to security incidents, such as data breaches or malware infections. It should include the roles and responsibilities of each team member, how they will identify and respond to threats (contain, mitigate, recover), how to communicate with key stakeholders as well as how they will document their response. The incident response plan should also be regularly tested and updated to ensure that it remains effective.

Another important aspect of building SOC is the implementation of security tools and technologies. Organizations should use a variety of tools to monitor and detect threats, such as firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion detection systems, and log analysis tools. Organizations also should consider implementing security information and event management (SIEM) systems and threat intelligence platforms to help the SOC team detect and respond to potential threats. Additionally, organizations should create and maintain secure configurations for their networks and systems to reduce the risk of security incidents.

Aside from the process and technologies, it is also crucial to have a team of skilled and experienced security professionals to manage and operate the SOC. These professionals should have a deep understanding of the organization’s security architecture, as well as the ability to detect and respond to potential security incidents. Additionally, organizations should ensure that their SOC team has access to the necessary resources and training to keep up with the latest threats and technologies.

Building SOC is a complex and ongoing process that requires careful planning, implementation and maintenance to ensure that the organization's security posture remains strong. This includes regular testing and review of SIEM use cases, regular testing of the incident response plan, and periodic threat hunting as well as penetration testing to identify adversaries and vulnerabilities in the organization systems.

Finally, organizations should ensure that their SOC is properly integrated into their overall security strategy. This includes ensuring that all processes, technologies, and personnel are aligned with the organization’s security goals and objectives. Doing so will help organizations better detect, respond to, and mitigate potential security incidents in a timely manner.

In the next article, we will cover the first step in building SOC. Assess the organization's current security posture and identify any gaps or weaknesses.
