Hashgraph is a distributed ledger technology (DLT) that has recently been gaining attention for its unique approach to data storage and its potential to revolutionize the way we think about secure and transparent data storage. Hashgraph stands out from other DLT platforms due to its superior speed and security, making it an attractive solution for a variety of industries. Its ability to process thousands of transactions per second, its sophisticated consensus algorithm, and its ability to store data immutably make it a great choice for large-scale applications. Additionally, its use of a virtual voting system and its asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) algorithm make it an attractive option for distributed networks and applications. With its unique approach to data storage, Hashgraph is setting a new standard for DLT and is poised to be a leader in the industry.

## What is Hashgraph?

A hashgraph is a distributed ledger technology that is used to create a secure and transparent public ledger with the help of which users can create and verify timestamps. It is an alternative to blockchain and is considered to be a more efficient and modern technology. Unlike Blockchain technology that is based on Proof of Work consensus algorithm, which is an extremely energy-intensive process. Hashgraph, on the other hand, uses a Proof of Stakes combined with gossip about gossip protocol and virtual voting system where the individual nodes on the network gossip about transaction to create Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG). This algorithm allows for the creation of a very low energy-intensive process.

## Benefits of Hashgraph

- Low Energy - on a paper by the University College London (UCL) Centre for Blockchain Technologies, stated that Hedera that use the hashgraph algorithm are the greenest Proof-of-stake network among others, which use 0.020 watt hour per transaction (Wh/tx).
- Superior Speed - Hashgraph allows thousands of transactions per second to be verified and recorded on the ledger. This is a huge advantage over blockchain technology, which is commonly cited as unable to handle large numbers of transactions due to scalability issues.
- Fast Finality - finality refers to the process of determining that a certain block of transactions has been fully and irreversibly confirmed on the network. This is important for ensuring the integrity of the blockchain and preventing double-spending or other forms of fraud. While blockchain finality is based on the addition of blocks and the more blocks that are added on top of a particular block, the more certain the network is that it will not be reversed. Hashgraph finality is based on a consensus mechanism that allows for faster confirmation of transactions and greater scalability for the network and considered as a stronger form of finality.
- Highest Grade of Security - the Hashgraph consensus algorithms is asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) algorithm - meaning this algorithm makes the hashgraph resistant to malicious attacks and makes it impossible to break the system by generating fake data.

## Potential applications of Hashgraph

- Financial and Banking - Hashgraph can be used to securely store data related to financial transactions, making it an attractive option for banks.
- Healthcare and Insurance - The healthcare and insurance industries can use hashgraph to store patient information and create a transparent record of all data related to medical treatments and insurance claims.
- Tourism and Hospitality - The travel and hospitality industries can use hashgraph to create a secure and transparent record of all data related to reservations and client information.
- Energy - Energy companies can use hashgraph to create a transparent record of transactions, including information about the source of energy production.
- Education - Educational institutions can use hashgraph to create secure records of data related to student information, including transcripts, grades, and attendance.
- Legal and Law Enforcement - Legal departments can use hashgraph to create an evidence trail of all communications related to cases and investigations.
- Other industries - There are a number of other industries that can benefit from the implementation of hashgraph, including agriculture, automotive, and insurance.

## Conclusion

In the end, while blockchain has proven to be a reliable and secure technology with real-world applications, it is important to keep in mind that it is not perfect, and there are several shortcomings associated with its design. This is why there is a need for alternative technologies, such as hashgraph, that can overcome some of the limitations of blockchain while also providing additional benefits to users. This technology is still relatively new, but it is already showing a lot of promise, and there is no doubt that it will play an important role in the future of distributed ledger technology.
