Artificial intelligence (AI) is making waves in the technology industry with its potential to change the world. Businesses are now racing to integrate AI into their products and services as quickly as possible. The demand for AI has grown so much that the market for AI solutions is expected to grow by more than double by 2021. With the popularity of AI increasing, businesses are trying to create new applications and services leveraging this technology. But what exactly is artificial intelligence? If you need a refresher, read on!

## What is Artificial Intelligence?
AI is computer software that enables computer systems to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. The term “Artificial Intelligence” was first used in 1956 by computer scientist John McCarthy. AI can be used to solve a variety of problems, including computer vision, natural language processing, and logistics. While AI is often used to refer to advanced computer programming, it’s also used to describe the broader concept of machines that can “think” like humans. Artificial intelligence is a way of designing computer systems that can increase the ability to solve complex problems, like machine learning and computer vision. What we mean is that the system has the ability to improve itself based on experience. It’s the concept of building computers that can do more than follow a set of instructions. It’s the idea of designing systems that can learn and adapt to different situations.

## How Does AI Work?
AI agents are based on algorithms that can learn from data and make predictions. Those algorithms are then implemented in computer programs that can take action based on those predictions. Here are a few ways machines can learn: 
- Machine learning: This uses algorithms to “teach” computers to learn from data. A computer program breaks down its data into smaller pieces so that it can find patterns and make predictions. It is a very common type of AI that’s used in everything from online search engines to autonomous vehicles.
- Natural language processing: This is a method for machines to process human language. It’s a common task for computers, like voice recognition software or basic chatbots.
- Computer vision: This is a type of AI that helps machines interpret images. It’s used in autonomous vehicles (AVs), computer-assisted medical procedures, and computer graphics.

## 5 Industries AI Will Disrupt
- Healthcare: AI-powered software can help doctors with diagnosing diseases and looking at scans. This software can also be used to help patients manage their health care by tracking their symptoms, monitoring their medication, and recommending diet changes based on their health history.
- Transportation: Self-driving cars and delivery drones are already being developed with the help of AI. AVs are expected to disrupt transportation and have a significant impact on the environment: fewer cars on the road will mean less carbon emissions.
- Finance: AI has already been used to develop trading algorithms and manage investment funds. AI could be used to manage your retirement funds, help you invest in stocks, and figure out your monthly budget.
- Education: AI can be used to create personalized lesson plans for students based on their skill level. There are also AI tutoring systems that use machine learning algorithms to help students learn and review their grades.
- Journalism: News organizations are turning to AI to write their articles. Some journalists are even turning to AI to help them write more creative stories. Journalists can use AI to scrape data, find patterns, and look for interesting facts.

## 3 Problems with AI Today
- Data bias: AI algorithms are always trained using data that’s been collected previously. So, if the data is biased, then the AI that is trained on those data will pick up on that bias.
- Lack of employees with AI skills: According to a survey by PwC, 73 percent of businesses say they plan to increase their investments in AI over the next three years. But they’re struggling to find the right employees to work on AI projects: only 8 percent of businesses say they have enough employees with the right AI skills.
- Security breaches: As AI becomes more common in business, it’s likely that hackers will try to break into systems and steal information.

## Conclusion

If businesses want to be successful, they need to start integrating AI into their products and services as soon as possible. AI is expected to change the way we live and work, and businesses need to embrace it fully if they want to stay relevant. There are still a lot of challenges to overcome before AI can truly live up to its promise. But with continued investment and research, AI will soon change how we work, travel, and learn.
