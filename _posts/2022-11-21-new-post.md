## Conclusion

I'm not sure what motivated Microsoft to differentiate PPs and PPLs regarding _Known DLLs_ in the first place. Perhaps it was a matter of performance, I don't know. Anyhow, they were already aware of this potential weakness, otherwise they wouldn't have made an exception for PPs I guess. The thing is, this security hole is now patched and that's a good step forward. I like to think I played a little role in this change although I'm totally aware that all the work had already been done by Alex and James.

In conclusion, this is indeed "_The End of PPLdump_". However, this tool leveraged only one weakness of PPLs, but there is a couple of other userland issues we can probably still exploit. So, from my standpoint, it is also an opportunity to start working on another bypass...
